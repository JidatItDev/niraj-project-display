        ques: `Can I get a homeowner’s quote without inspections?`,
        ans: `The answer varies depending on the type of home and the year it
was built. For Single Family or Multifamily homes, if the home 
was built more that 20 years ago, then a quote without an 
inspection is going to be extremely inaccurate, and for that 
reason, we cannot provide a quote. Any home that was built less 
than 20 years ago or after the year 2005 – it is possible to get a 
quote, although a wind mitigation inspection could possibly be 
beneficial to get a better rate. For Condos, quotes are possible 
without an inspection, although, a wind mitigation inspection 
could also be helpful to lower the premium. Keep in mind that, 
some companies may require a inspections for a policy still, even
if they provide a quote.`

        ques: `How long do my 4 point and Wind Mitigation inspections last?`,
        ans: `4 point inspections are good for 1 year, while Wind Mitigation 
inspections are good for 5 years. Keep in mind that, if any 
upgrades are done to your roof, windows or doors, you would 
need a new Wind Mitigation inspection to get the credit applied 
for that.`

        ques: `I have an Alarm, do I get a discount?`,
        ans: `In order to get this discount, you need to supply the “Alarm 
Certificate” from the company that you have purchased your 
monitoring service from. The alarm must be monitored to receive
a discount. Ultimately, this will depend on the company and how 
they apply the discount – some companies do not offer the 
discount, some only offer it if a certain amount of coverage is 
purchased, and all of them will offer the discount at a different 
rate.`

    {
        ques: `Am I in a Flood Zone and do I need flood insurance?`,
        ans: `Yes, you are in a flood zone. The state of Florida is entirely in a 
flood zone. Florida is divided into multiple different flood zones, 
ranging from “Low Risk” to “High Risk”. What people generally 
ask this question for is whether it is required by law, and the 
answer is no. The requirement is usually by your mortgage 
company, the mortgage company will require you to carry a 
policy if you are in a “High Risk” flood zone. Several flood zones 
are considered “High Risk” and we can check which one you are 
in for you.`

    {
        ques: `How much coverage do I need on my home?`,
        ans: `The common mistake people make is assuming that their home 
should be insured for the market value of the home. However, 
many factors play into what the market value could be, where as
the insurable value is only concerned with the cost to build the 
home back to the current state. That number will be determined 
by each insurance company, using their own appraising tool, 
called the Replacement Cost Estimator.`

    {
        ques: `Will my mortgage pay for my Homeowner’s Insurance?`,
        ans: `Most homeowners that have a mortgage have an escrow account
that will pay for the year’s premium, and then the payments will 
be rolled into your monthly mortgage payment. This is 
something that you will need to discuss with your mortgage to 
see if you have it set up that way, or if it is possible to. All of the 
insurance companies that we work with are able to accept 
payments from a mortgage company, as long as it is set up to do
so.`
    },
    {
        ques: `Can I get insurance for the amount left on my mortgage?`,
        ans: `This question often comes from homeowners that are close to 
paying off their mortgage, and simply put the answer is no. The 
insurance company is not able to cover the loan amount alone, 
they must cover the amount that the home costs to rebuild.`
    },
    {
        ques: `How quickly can we get a quote?`,
        ans: `Our typical turnaround time is 24 hours or less. However, we 
want to be thorough, so in some cases it can take up to 72 hours 
if carriers are taking longer to respond to us, or if we think that 
we can find something better for you by searching a little more. 
Longer turn around times are usually due to atypical 
circumstances, i.e. luxury homes or homes with claims or homes 
in high risk areas.`
