        text: `"When my first insurance company suddenly dropped, I was in complete panic mode. As a first time homeowner, there were many things i wasn't privy too. You can imagine my stress when I was automatically placed under a new policy that was 8k more than my original. This was well over my budget and would've eventually lost my house. Thats when Niraj came to the rescue. He worked with me and found the right policy for my home. He was very informative, patient and  expeditious. Owning a new home and not knowing its potential pitfalls isn't as intimidating when you have someone like him in your corner. Thank you Niraj."`,
